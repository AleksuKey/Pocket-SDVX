# Pocket-SDVX
A mini controller for games such as Sound Voltex, USC, KShoot, osu 4k, etc.  Based off of mon's Pocket Voltex and Cammy's pocketvtx!

## Features
- Super small - About 7" x 4" and a little over 1/2" high (About 1-1/2" including knobs)
- 7 Gateron Red Keyswitches (Start, BT-A, BT-B, BT-C, BT-D, FX-L, FX-R)
- PBT G20 Keycaps
- Quality Bourns Encoders (VOL-L, VOL-R)
- Solid Aluminum Black 20mm Knobs
- Vinyl Skinned Top & Bottom
- 6 Rubber Feet
- Single Screw Back Panel
- Arduino Pro Micro based
- Acts as a gamepad or keyboard/mouse.  While plugging in, hold BTN-A for 3-4s for gamepad mode.  Hold BTN-B instead for keyboard/mouse mode.
- USB-C Input

## Video Guide
- A really low-quality video guide series I made at 4:00am: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSlCMOwxujV7-DYrM4eC2Sb4_rMR5udEE .
  - Perhaps it will be useful to some of you.

## General Assembly Instructions
- 3D print case and cover
- Cut vinyls: layer1, layer2, cover
- Weed vinyls(remove excess).
- Clean face with rubbing/isopropyl alcohol and apply skin using transfer tape.  Apply layer1, then layer2.  Then apply cover.
  - Note: Shine a flashlight on the case's corner to more easily see where to line up the skin.  I make my skins every so slightly smaller than the actual face for more leeway.  The skin's width is ~169mm (scale the skin proportionally).
  - Note 2: I have lazily taken cover and scaled it down.  Thus, the spacing around the edge is probably a bit uneven.  Apply to the best of your ability.  The skin's width is ~165mm (scale the skin proportionally).
- Insert Gateron switches and secure each corner of the switch with hot glue on the inside.  See video Part 1 for details.
- Using a soldering iron, tin all contacts on the Gateron switches.
- Wire up all the common/ground for the switches and the encoders.  See video Part 2 for details.
- Wire up all the switches and encoders with their own individual wire.
- Solder all the wires to the board.  See video Part 3 for details.
  - Arduino Pro Micro Pinout
    - VOL-L A 2
    - VOL-L B 3
    - VOL_R A RX1
    - VOL_R B TX0
    - BT_ST   4
    - BT_A    5
    - BT_B    6
    - BT_C    7
    - BT_D    8
    - FX_L    9
    - FX_R    10
- Plug in your arduino and flash firmware.  See video Part 4 for details.
- BOOT IN KEYBOARD MODE(Hold the second button from the left for 3-4s while plugging it in).  TEST to make sure everything works.  See video Part 5 for details.
- Plug in micro usb to USB-C adapter cable into the arduino.  Slide arduino into its slot and route the USB-C cable.  See video Part 6 for details.
- Push encoders through their holes.  Mount with washer and nut.
- Bend metal encoder mounting tabs 45 degrees outward.  Additionally, bend one of the protrusions slightly inward so it doesn't collide with the micro usb cable.
- Do some cable management.  Carefully flatten the cables.
- Hot glue USB-C port.
- Slide in the cover and secure with M3x5 screw.  PLEASE be careful, as you are threading into plastic and thus the hole is easily strippable.  See video Part 7 for details.
- Wipe circles on the bottom with rubbing/isopropyl alcohol.  Apply adhesive rubber feet.
- Mount keycaps.  See video Part 8 for details.
- Mount knobs.  Use the arduino pin headers as a spacer on each side so the knobs are the same height and don't rub on the encoder nub.
### Done.  Enjoy!!

## Miscellaneous Info
- If the rubber feet aren't doing their job, they're probably dusty.  Wipe them down with a little bit of rubbing alcohol.
- Encoders have an initial break-in period.  If they are stiff, rotate them for a few minutes to break them in.
